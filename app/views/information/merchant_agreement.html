<ol>
	<li><strong>Registration as a Cogster Merchant</strong>. The Cogster marketplace is a person-to-person online pre-paid goods and services Platform (the "Platform") operated by Cogster for the registration of Merchants and Members, the receipt, display and matching of listings and offers for pre-paid goods and services and the origination and sale of those pre-paid goods and services. The following Agreement describes the services and your rights and obligations should you elect to register as a Merchant on the Platform. Cogster is referred to in this Agreement as "we" or "us."
	<p>We reserve the right to restrict access to the Platform to individuals who meet minimum credit guidelines and other criteria, as determined by us in our sole discretion.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Listings</strong>. You offer pre-paid goods and services by posting a listing on the Platform. The minimum and maximum amounts you may request are posted on the Cogster website and are subject to change by us at any time without notice. To post a listing, you may provide the amount of the funds you are requesting.
	<p>Cogster Members may ask you questions about your listing and you may, but are not required to, respond to such questions. If you do elect to respond to a Member's question you may respond privately, or you may elect to have the question and answer posted publicly in the listing. Members' questions are not posted in the listing or displayed elsewhere on our website unless you elect to answer the question and elect to make the question and answer publicly available, in which case the question and answer appears in the listing.</p>
	<p>Merchant listings are displayed on the Platform. This means that people who visit the Cogster website will be able to view your listing. Upon your submission of a listing, you authorize Cogster to display the listing on the Platform for purposes of offering pre-paid goods and services and for enabling Cogster Members who have purchased your pre-paid goods or services to offer such goods or services to other Members at any time while your obligation is outstanding. You authorize and agree that Cogster may obtain and display updated information from your credit file with one or more consumer credit reporting agencies, as well as information about the payment history and status of your obligation to provide pre-paid goods and services, on the Platform at any time or times that your obligation is offered for sale by Members holding such obligations. To facilitate acceptance for your listing or for listings posted by Members offering to sell such obligations, Cogster may forward the listing by email to third parties, including but not limited to registered Cogster Members, and may display the listing in promotional, advertising and marketing materials, and you authorize Cogster to do so.</p>
	<p>You authorize Cogster to verify your business location, income, line of business and any other information you provide in connection with a listing or your registration as a Merchant, and you agree that Cogster may contact third parties to verify information you provide. If such information changes after you post a listing but before the listing expires, you must either (i) promptly notify Cogster of the change, or (ii) withdraw your listing. If you elect to withdraw your listing as a result of a change, you may (but are not required to) post a new listing containing the updated information. You cannot edit or amend your listing once it is posted on the Platform; however, you have the right to withdraw your listing at any time prior to expiration of the listing, and you may post another listing if you desire. Cogster reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit the number of listings you post or attempt to post on the Platform.</p>
	<p>Your listing is a request for the sale of pre-paid goods and services in the amount specified in the listing. In order to post a listing on the Platform, you must have good faith intent to provide the pre-paid goods or services and your listing must be consistent with that intent.</p>
	<p>You have the right to withdraw your listing at any time prior to expiration of the listing. If your listing receives a Member offer in, or Member offers totaling, the amount of your requested funding, you may receive funding from Cogster in the amount you requested, subject to our right to verify information you provided in connection with your listing and your registration as a Cogster user and our other rights as described in Sections 3 and 6, below. If funding is made to you, you do not have any right to rescind the obligation.</p>
	<p>Number of Listings. Cogster reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit the number of listings you post or attempt to post on the Platform. You may have only one listing outstanding at a time.</p>
	<p>Duration of Listings. When you post a listing, your listing will be displayed on the Platform for thirty (30) days or for such other time period that we may in our sole discretion establish and amend from time to time. However, if your listing receives a Member offer in, or Member offers totaling, the full amount of your requested Memberships prior to expiration of your listing, you may elect to end your listing early - you need not wait until your listing expires. When you post a listing, it will be displayed on the Platform along with all other listings until you end the listing or the listing expires, or until the listing is withdrawn by you or by us as provided in Section 3 below.</p>
	<p>Prohibited Activities. You agree that you will not, in connection with any listings or other transactions involving or potentially involving Cogster, (i) make any false, misleading or deceptive statements or omissions of material fact in your listing; (ii) offer illegal goods or services; (iii) misrepresent your identity, or describe, present or portray yourself as a person other than yourself, whether in a narrative description or a photo in your listing; or (iv) represent yourself to any person as a director, officer or employee of Cogster, unless you are such director, officer or employee.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Verify Information and Cancel Funding.</strong>
	<ul class="alpha_list">
		<li>We reserve the right to verify the accuracy of all information provided by Merchants, and Members in connection with listings. We also reserve the right to determine in our sole discretion whether a registered user is using, or has used, the Cogster website illegally or in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Cogster Terms and Conditions or any agreement between Cogster and such user. We may conduct our review at any time - before, during or after the posting of a listing, or before or after the funding. You agree to respond promptly to our requests for information in connection with your listing, accounts, or your registration with Cogster.</li>
		<li>In the event we determine, prior to funding, that a listing contains materially inaccurate information (including but not limited to unintended inaccuracies, inaccuracies resulting from errors by Cogster, or inaccuracies resulting from changes in the Merchant's income, or credit profile between the date a listing is posted and the date the listing is to be funded) or was posted illegally or in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Cogster Terms and Conditions or any registration agreement, we may refuse to post the listing or, if the listing has already been posted, remove the listing from the Platform and cancel all offers against the listing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Matching of Offers and Listings; Funding.</strong>
	<ul class="alpha_list">
		<li>Registered Cogster Members will be able to review your listing and may commit funds to purchase, in various amounts, pre-paid goods and services to be provided by you. This means that the Cogster Members will receive pre-paid goods and services. You acknowledge and agree that a Member's commitment to purchase pre-paid goods and services corresponding to all or a portion of your funding from us does not confer any rights to you. You also acknowledge and agree that Cogster Members make their own decisions whether to commit funds.</li>
		<li>Cogster's Platform will automatically match your listing with any Member offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services. Most listings are matched with multiple Member offers.
</li>
		<li>A match of your listing with one or more offers in the full amount of your requested funding results in funding from Cogster to you, subject to our right to verify information as provided in this Agreement. Proceeds are disbursed into your designated deposit account. Cogster will service all funding made to Cogster Merchant Members through the Platform.</li>
		<li>We do not warrant or guaranty that your listing will be matched with any Member offers. Your listing must receive Member offers totaling the entire amount of your requested funding in order for funding to be made.
</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li><strong>Right to Refuse or Remove Listing.</strong>  In the event we determine, prior to funding, that a listing contains materially inaccurate information (including but not limited to unintended inaccuracies, inaccuracies resulting from errors by Cogster, or inaccuracies resulting from changes in the Merchant's income, or credit profile between the date a listing is posted and the date the listing is to be funded) or was posted illegally or in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Cogster Terms and Conditions or any registration agreement, we may refuse to post the listing or, if the listing has already been posted, remove the listing from the Platform and cancel all offers against the listing.</li>
		<li><strong>Compensation</strong> If you receive funding, you must pay Cogster a marketing fee. The current fee amounts are posted in the Fees and Charges section of the Cogster website, or, if not posted on the website, are equal to 10% of the funding amount, and are subject to change by us at any time without notice. The transaction fee is paid by the Merchant out of the proceeds at the time of funding, so that the net amount of proceeds you receive will be less than the full amount of your requested funding.</li>
	<li><strong>Compensation</strong>. If you receive funding, you must pay Cogster a marketing fee. The current fee amounts are posted in the Fees and Charges section of the Cogster website, and are subject to change by us at any time without notice.

	<li><strong>Providing Pre-Paid Goods and Services</strong>. At the time you register as a Merchant, you must provide your deposit account information to facilitate transfers of funds to and from your deposit account. Cogster will act as the servicer for all Memberships, and all communications regarding your funding must be made to Cogster. You agree to honor certificates issued on your behalf by Cogster. Cogster will issue certificates, in a form determined exclusively by Cogster, to contributing Members in the amount of the particular purchasing Option (the “Option”) you list and Member selects. The first Option, Option A, includes:  for each $10 unit purchased by a Member, the Member receives from Cogster and you agree to honor: one $10 certificate, awarded within the first 30 days of each Member’s original date of purchase, one additional $5 certificate between days 31 and 60, counted from each Member’s original date of purchase, and one additional $5 certificate, between days 61 and 90, counted from each Member’s original date of purchase, with each certificate having a redemption period of 30 days from the date of its issuance.  Cogster will determine the method the certificate is delivered to the Members (e.g., paper copy, electronically or via a Membership card). You are responsible for tracking the gift certificates you receive. Cogster’s only obligation is to provide you with notice of the gift certificates Cogster has distributed. Cogster is not responsible for counterfeit or unauthorized certificate use, and Cogster recommends that you record gift certificates accepted in order to prevent unauthorized certificates. You agree to treat the certificates as cash, and to not put limits on their use, such as blackout dates or restrictions on the purchase of discounted/special/sale items, etc.  A second Option, Option B, may be selected by you, if available on the website, and include a somewhat different number of days and a different number of certificates, with differing values.  Provided you opt to post a listing under Option B, you agree to honor the certificates, their amounts, over the number of days you select.</li>
	<li><strong>Collection &amp; Reporting of Failure to Honor</strong>. In the event you do not provide your pre-paid goods and services on time, Cogster, as the original Member, will have all remedies authorized or permitted by applicable law. Subject to limitations of applicable law, you authorize and agree that Cogster may contact you at any or all of the telephone numbers you provide to Cogster at or after registration, or any of your other telephone numbers.</li>
	<li><strong>No Guarantee</strong>. COGSTER DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE (1) THAT YOUR LISTING WILL RECEIVE ANY OFFERS, OR (2) THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE FUNDING AS A RESULT OF POSTING A LISTING.</li>
	<li><strong>Restrictions on Use</strong>. You are not authorized or permitted to use the Cogster website to obtain, or attempt to obtain, funding for someone other than yourself. You must be an owner of the deposit account you designate for electronic transfers of funds. Your designated account will be the account into which proceeds will be deposited. Although you are registering as a Merchant, you may also register and participate on the Platform as a Member. If you obtain funding and fail to provide the pre-paid goods or services in full, whether due to default, bankruptcy or other reasons, you will not be eligible to post any further listings or re-register with Cogster as a Merchant or Member. Cogster may in its sole discretion, with or without cause and with or without notice, restrict your access to the Cogster website or Platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Authority</strong>. You warrant and represent that you have the legal competence and capacity to execute and perform this Agreement.</li>
	<li><strong>Termination of Registration</strong>. Cogster may in its sole discretion, with or without cause, terminate this Agreement at any time by giving you notice as provided below. In addition, upon Cogster's determination that you committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation in connection with a listing, offer or funding, performed any prohibited activity, or otherwise failed to abide by the terms of this Agreement or the Cogster Terms and Conditions, Cogster may, in its sole discretion, immediately and without notice, take one or more of the following actions: (i) terminate or suspend your right to post listings or otherwise participate on the Platform; (ii) terminate this Agreement and your registration with Cogster. Upon termination of this Agreement and your registration with Cogster, any listings you have posted on the Platform shall terminate, and will be removed from the Platform immediately. Any funding you obtain prior to the effective date of termination resulting from listings you had placed on the Platform shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.</li>
	<li><strong>Cogster's Right to Modify Terms</strong>. Cogster has the right to change any term or provision of this Agreement or the Cogster Terms and Conditions. Cogster will give you notice of material changes to this Agreement, or the Cogster Terms and Conditions, in the manner set forth in Section 14. You authorize Cogster to correct obvious clerical errors appearing in information you provide to Cogster, without notice to you, although Cogster expressly undertakes no obligation to identify or correct such errors. This Agreement, along with the Cogster Terms and Conditions, represent the entire agreement between you and Cogster regarding your participation as a Merchant on the Platform, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, promises and proposals, whether oral, written or electronic, between you and Cogster with respect to your involvement as a Merchant on the Platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Member Page Display and Content</strong>. You may, but are not required to, maintain a listing on the Cogster website, where you can post photos, content, logos or links to websites. If you elect to do so, you authorize Cogster to display on the Cogster website all such material you provide to Cogster. Any material you display on your listing must conform to the Cogster Terms and Conditions, as amended from time to time, and material you display or link to must not (i) infringe on Cogster's or any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or right of publicity or privacy; (ii) violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (iii) be defamatory or libelous; (iv) be lewd, hateful, violent, pornographic or obscene; (v) violate any laws regarding unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising; (vi) promote violence or contain hate speech; or (vii) contain viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines.</li>
	<li><strong>Notices</strong>. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be given by email to your registered email address or will be posted on the Cogster website, and shall be deemed to have been duly given and effective upon transmission or posting. You can contact us by sending an email to Steve@cogster.com. You also agree to notify Cogster if your registered email address changes and you agree to update your registered mailing address and telephone number on the Cogster website if your address or telephone number changes.</li>
	<li><strong>Authorization to Obtain Credit Report</strong>. You authorize us to obtain a credit report from one or more consumer credit reporting agencies. We may use the credit report for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to (i) for authentication purposes, to make sure you are who you say you are, (ii) to determine how much debt you currently have, in order to determine your debt-to-income ratio, (iii) to obtain your credit score. You authorize us to verify information in your credit report, and you agree that Cogster may contact third parties to verify any such information. We may obtain your credit report each time you post a listing, except that we may not obtain a new credit report when you post listings within thirty (30) days following the posting of an earlier listing.</li>
	<li><strong>No Warranties</strong>.  EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, COGSTER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY WITH REGARD TO YOUR USE OF THE COGSTER WEBSITE AND THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</li>
	<li><strong>Limitation on Liability</strong>.  IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FURTHERMORE, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO ANY OTHER PARTY REGARDING THE EFFECT THAT THE AGREEMENT MAY HAVE UPON THE FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL TAX LIABILITY OF THE OTHER.</li>
	<li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>. You may not assign, transfer, sublicense or otherwise delegate your rights under this Agreement to another person without Cogster's prior written consent. Any such assignment, transfer, sublicense or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void. You must use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the gift certificate obligation in the event of a sale or transfer of your business. This Agreement shall be governed by federal law and, to the extent that state law applies, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not be a waiver of any other subsequent breach. Failure or delay by either party to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such term or condition. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.</li>
