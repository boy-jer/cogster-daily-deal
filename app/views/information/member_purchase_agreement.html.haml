      %h2.alt Cogster Member Purchase Agreement
      %p This Member Registration Agreement is made and entered into between you and Local Markets, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation d/b/a Cogster ("Cogster", "we", or "us"). This Agreement will govern all purchases of pre-paid goods and services that you may, from time to time, purchase through Cogster.

          %strong Registration as a Cogster Member.
          You are registering as a Member in the Cogster marketplace, so that you may be eligible to purchase pre-paid goods and services from listings displayed on Cogster's online marketplace (the "Platform"). You agree to comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Terms of Use of the Cogster website, and the policies posted on the Cogster website, as amended from time to time by Cogster in its sole discretion (collectively, the "Cogster Terms and Conditions").
          %p Your role as a Cogster "Member" is that of a purchaser of certificates for pre-paid goods and services issued by Cogster on behalf of participating Merchant, and your rights and obligations as a purchaser or prospective purchaser of pre-paid goods and services are set forth below. You are referred to in this Agreement and on the Cogster website as a "Member." You are not acting as an investor in Cogster or the participating Merchants.
        %li
          %strong Purchasing Pre-Paid Goods and Services.
          As a registered Cogster Member, you may purchase pre-paid goods and services from listings displayed on the Platform. "Listings" are Cogster Merchant’s offers for the sale of pre-paid goods and services. Depending on the listing, listings include the desired minimum and maximum requested funding amount. Listings also include other information including but not limited to, location and description of goods and services available.
          %p On listings posted by Cogster Merchants, Cogster Members may ask Merchants questions about their listings and Merchants may, but are not required to, respond to such questions. Merchants who elect to respond to a Member's question may respond privately, or they may elect to have the question and answer posted publicly in the listing. Members' questions are not posted in the listing or displayed elsewhere on our website unless the Merchant elects to answer the question and elects to make the question and answer publicly available, in which case the question and answer appears in the listing. We do not verify any Merchants' responses to Members’ questions.
          %p An offer to purchase pre-paid goods and services by a Member on a listing is the Member's commitment to purchase from Cogster pre-paid goods and services in units of $10.00, provided that the listing has received purchase commitments totaling the minimum amount requested in the listing, if required. Members must have a credit card on file with Cogster in their Member Account (described below) with the amount of the offer to purchase. Once an offer to purchase is placed, it is irrevocable for the duration of the listing.
          %p Availability of Funds. At the time you place an offer to purchase pre-paid goods and services you must have funds available on the credit card listed in your Member Account with Cogster in at least the amount of your offer.
          %p Your Purchase Commitment. Each offer to purchase you post on the Platform is a commitment and promise to purchase pre-paid goods and services issued by Cogster, with the proceeds of the sale of the pre-paid goods and services used by Cogster to fund the specific Merchant funding request described in the listing on which the offer was made. Once you place an offer, you may not cancel or withdraw the offer or reduce the amount of the offer.
          %p AT THE TIME YOU SUBMIT AN OFFER ON A LISTING, YOU ARE COMMITTING TO PURCHASE PRE-PAID GOODS AND SERVICES ISSUED BY COGSTER IN THE AMOUNT OF YOUR OFFER, THAT IS DEPENDENT FOR ITS PAYMENT ON THE CONTINUING OPERATION OF THE MERCHANT.
          %p Limits on Purchases of Pre-Paid Goods and Services. Members may purchase the entire amount requested by the Merchant or that posted the listing, or may offer to purchase a lesser amount, in $10 increments, subject to a minimum offer amount of $10. Maximum per person purchase amounts may be defined by Merchants in their individual listings.
        %li
          %strong Acceptance of Offer and Listings. 
          %ul.alpha_list
            %li When you place an offer on a listing, your offer will be combined with other Member offers placed against the listing, and will be considered to be "accepted" to the extent the offer does not exceed the total maximum funding request by the Merchant. Your offer to purchase pre-paid goods and services remains outstanding on a listing until the listing is funded, withdrawn by the Merchant or removed by Cogster in accordance with Section 9 below. If the listing is withdrawn or removed, your offer will be cancelled, and your funds that were committed to your offer will be available for further purchases of pre-paid goods and services.
            %li Cogster does not warrant or guaranty that your offers will be accepted for any listings. In the event some, but not all, of the funds you offer become accepted by a listing (for example, when you are the last Member offering to purchase pre-paid goods and services on a listing), you are committed to purchasing pre-paid goods and services issued by Cogster in the amount of the portion of your funds that accepted against the listing, and the remainder of your funds will not be drawn from the credit card account, available for further purchases of pre-paid goods and services.
            %li In most instances a listing is matched with more than one offer to purchase pre-paid goods and services, and you will be one of several Members who purchase pre-paid goods and services that correspond to the Merchant funding request described in the listing.
            %li To safeguard your privacy right, the identities and addresses of Members are not displayed on the Platform or elsewhere on the Cogster website. Your identity and contact information, including name, address, e-mail address and phone number, may be provided to Merchants from whom you purchase pre-paid goods and services. You may opt out of having information provided to Merchants through your Member Account

          %strong Funding and Trade of Merchant Pre-Paid Goods and Services
	        Once a Member has committed to purchase pre-paid goods and services and the listing for such Merchant funding receives offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services from Members totaling the minimum amount requested in the listing for the Merchant funding, we proceed with the funding of the corresponding Merchant request, and with the issuance of certificates for pre-paid goods and services to the Members who were the winning bidders on the listing. You must commit to the purchase of pre-paid goods and services through the Platform before we will proceed with funding of the Merchant request.  In specific situations, the minimum amount required for the listing to become funded is zero ($0.00), in which case, any offer you make that is greater than or equal to ten dollars ($10), you must commit to the purchase of pre-paid goods and services through the Platform for the amount you offered.
          %p Cogster Merchant Listings. With respect to Cogster Merchant listings, funding occurs when proceeds are disbursed into the Merchant's designated deposit account. All Merchant funding resulting from Cogster Merchant listings will be evidenced by the Merchant’s agreement to honor certificates for their pre-paid goods and services, within a specified period of time (the “Period”). The Merchant agrees that a certificate will be issued by Cogster, in a form determined exclusively by Cogster, to contributing Members in the amount of the particular purchasing Option (the “Option”) the Member selects:  The first Option, Option A, includes:  for each $10 unit purchased by a Member, the Member receives from Cogster: one $10 certificate, awarded within the first 30 days of each Member’s original date of purchase, one additional $5 certificate between days 31 and 60, counted from each Member’s original date of purchase, and one additional $5 certificate, between days 61 and 90, counted from each Member’s original date of purchase, with each certificate having a redemption period of 30 days from the date of its issuance. Cogster will determine the method the certificate is delivered to you (e.g., paper copy, electronically or via a Membership card).  A second Option, Option B, may be presented by a Merchant to you, if available on the website, and include a somewhat different number of days and a different number of certificates, with differing values. 
	<li><strong>Purchase and Sale.</strong> At the time a Merchant funding request is funded by Cogster, we proceed with the provision of funds to the Merchant and the issuance of the one-time certificates, or the first period’s certificates, in the event of a multi-period scenario, to the contributing Members.
	<p>Terms. The contributing Members will have their credit cards charged for the amount of the pre-paid goods and services at the time of purchase. At that time the first certificate will be issued by Cogster, in a form to be determined by Cogster, to the Member in the amount defined by the selected Option, as noted in Paragraph 4, above, for every $10 unit of funds provided by the Member. Subsequent certificates, if provided by the selected Option, will be issued for the defined amount on the anniversary date of funding for the following period, as defined in Paragraph 4.</p>
	<p>REDEPEMPTION OF THE CERTIFICATES FOR PRE-PAID GOODS AND SERVICES IS DEPENDENT ON THE ON-GOING OPERATIONS OF THE MERCHANT. COGSTER DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE IN ANY MANNER THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE PRE-PAID GOODS AND SERVICES YOU EXPECT TO RECEIVE. COGSTER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS AS TO A MERCHANT'S ABILITY TO REDEEM THE CERTIFICATES PROVIDED IN EXCHANGE FOR FUNDING.</p>
	<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT MERCHANTS MAY DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE PRE-PAID GOODS AND SERVICES AND THAT SUCH DEFAULTS WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, YOU MAY RECEIVE UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Representations and Warranties.</strong>  Cogster makes the following representations and warranties to you, with respect to the pre-paid goods and services sold to you under this Agreement, as of the date the certificates for pre-paid goods and services are sold, assigned and transferred to you:
	<ul class="alpha_list">
		<li>Cogster has complied in all material respects with applicable federal, state and local laws in connection with the offer and sale.</li>
		<li>The proceeds of the Merchant funding corresponding to the listing to which you subscribed have been fully disbursed to the Merchant or the Merchant's designated payee at the time certificates for pre-paid goods and services are issued to you, or upon a period of time, as defined by Cogster to Merchant.
</li>
		<li>In the event of a failure to redeem the pre-paid goods and services you purchase from Cogster under this Agreement that is the result of verifiable identity theft of the named Merchant's identity, Cogster will refund the amount charged to your credit card for the purchase of the pre-paid goods and services. The determination of whether verifiable identity theft has occurred shall be in Cogster's sole discretion. We may require proof of the identity theft, such as a copy of a police report filed by the person whose identity was wrongfully used to obtain the fraudulently-induced Merchant funding, an identity theft affidavit or a bank verification letter (or all of the above) in order to determine that verifiable identity theft has occurred. Cogster shall not be required to refund pre-paid goods and services under this subsection until such Merchant refuses to provide the goods and services, provided, however, that Cogster may in its sole discretion elect to refund the pre-paid goods and services at an earlier time. You agree that refund by Cogster of the funds you contributed is the sole remedy you will have with respect to any failure by the Merchant to provide such goods or services.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Remedies; Cure and Refund.</strong>  In the event of a breach by Cogster of any of the foregoing representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects your interest in pre-paid goods and services sold to you under this Agreement, Cogster shall either (i) cure the breach, if the breach is susceptible to cure, (ii) refund the amounts you provided for funding of the Merchant request, or (iii) indemnify and hold you harmless against all losses, damages, expenses, legal fees, costs and judgments resulting from any claim, demand or defense arising as a result of the breach. The decision whether a breach is susceptible to cure, or whether Cogster shall cure or refund, shall be in Cogster's sole discretion. Upon discovery by Cogster of any such breach of the foregoing representations and warranties requiring cure or refund, Cogster shall give you notice of the breach, and of Cogster's election to cure or refund, no later than ninety (90) days after our discovery of the breach. In the event Cogster refunds your funding amounts, Cogster will pay you a refund amount equal to the amount of your accepted offer for that particular Merchant listing. Cogster's obligation to cure or refund or indemnify you for a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties pursuant to this Section is your sole remedy with respect to a breach of Cogster's representations and warranties set forth in Section 6 above.</li>
	<li><strong>No Advisory Relationship.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the pre-paid goods and services pursuant to this Agreement is an arms-length transaction between you and Cogster; (ii) in connection with the purchase and sale of the pre-paid goods and services, Cogster is not acting as your agent or fiduciary; (iii) Cogster assumes no advisory or fiduciary responsibility in your favor in connection with the purchase and sale of the pre-paid goods and services; (iv) Cogster has not provided you with any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the pre-paid goods and services; and (v) you have consulted your own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent you have deemed it appropriate.</li>
	<li><strong>Cogster's Right to Verify Information and Cancel Funding.</strong>
	<ul class="alpha_list">
		<li>Cogster reserves the right to verify the accuracy of all information provided by Merchants and Members in connection with listings and funding. Cogster also reserves the right to determine in its reasonable discretion whether a registered user is using, or has used, the Cogster website illegally or in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Cogster Terms and Conditions or any agreement between Cogster and such user. Cogster may conduct its review before, during or after the posting of a listing, or before or after the funding of a Merchant listing for the sale of pre-paid goods and services. You agree to respond promptly to Cogster's requests for information in connection with your offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services, accounts, or your registration with Cogster.</li>
		<li>In the event Cogster, prior to the funding of a Merchant request, reasonably determines that a listing contains materially inaccurate information (including but not limited to unintended inaccuracies, inaccuracies resulting from errors by Cogster, or inaccuracies resulting from changes in the Merchant's income, residence or credit profile between the date a listing is posted and the date the listing is to be funded) or was posted illegally or in violation of any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality, for purposes of fraud or deception, or otherwise in a manner inconsistent with the Cogster Terms and Conditions or any registration agreement, Cogster may refuse to post the listing or, if the listing has already been posted, remove the listing from the Cogster marketplace and cancel all offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services against the listing.</li>
		<li>When a listing ends or expires with an offer or offers totaling the amount requested for the Merchant funding, Cogster may conduct a "pre-funding" review prior to the funding of the Merchant funding request. Cogster may, at any time and in its sole discretion, delay the funding of a Merchant listing in order to enable Cogster to verify the accuracy of information provided by Merchants, Members in connection with the listing or offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services pursuant to the listing, and to determine whether there are any irregularities with respect to the listing or offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services pursuant to the listing. Cogster may cancel or proceed with the funding of the Merchant listing, depending on the results of Cogster's pre-funding review. If funding is cancelled, the listing will be removed from the Cogster marketplace and all offers to purchase offers to purchase pre-paid goods and services pursuant to the listing will be cancelled, and each Members’ funds will be returned.</li>
		<li>In most instances, Cogster does not verify the income, occupation or other information provided by Merchants in listings. In Cogster Merchant listings, the Merchant's information is self-reported. Cogster does not verify any statements by Merchants in Cogster Merchant listings as to how proceeds are to be used and does not confirm after Merchant funding how the proceeds were used. The information in open market listings describing the Merchant’s offer to provide pre-paid goods and services for sale and the Merchant's characteristics are provided by the Member and are not verified by Cogster.</li>
